# Batik Classification
## About
This repository contains the final project of my Deep Learning Course in my 4th semester. The goal of the project is to classify batik images using deep learning method.
The project is made by 3 members:
* Brandon Ritchie Yang
* Landry Aidan Liauw
* Nicholas Irvin Suhendi

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Indonesian Batik Motifs taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dionisiusdh/indonesian-batik-motifs). 
The dataset contains 20 different batik motifs from Indonesia with each motifs contains around 50 images.
Only 3 batik motifs required to be classify, the lecturer gave us the freedom to choose which batik motifs to be use in the project. We random choose the batik motifs and got Batik Bali, Batik Parang, and Batik Tambal.

## Process
The code is written in google colab in ipynb format, the process include:
* Reading files from google drive
* Resizing and Normalizing image
* Data Augmentation
* Modelling
* Evaluation
